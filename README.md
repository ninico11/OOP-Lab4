The hierarchy in my program follows the hierarchy of a food chain, the main class is Animal, its children are the Carnivore class and the Herbivore class. The grandchildren are already following: the Rabbit, the Squirrel, the Wolf, the Marten, the Lizard, the Deer, the Fox and the Bear. The internal logic is close to the logic of a traffic chain
